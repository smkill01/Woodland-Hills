      <p>The city of Woodland Hills, a neighbor of the city of Middletown, is a home-rule class city 
      located in the gently rolling hills of eastern Jefferson County, Kentucky. Founded in 
      1962 as a new single-family development in the suburban Louisville area it provides a beautiful 
      and safe environment for all of its over 700 residents. The city amenities include 
      the 7-acre Hardy Brinly Park which provides ample green space for all sorts of outdoor 
      activities, including a newly-completed running path. </p>
      
      <p>Woodland Hills is conveniently located within walking distance of the Eastern High School 
      and Hite Elementary School campus. 
      The interchange of I-64 and I-264 is within 2 miles of the city giving direct access to 
      Louisville and outlying communities.</p>

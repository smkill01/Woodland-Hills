            located in the gently rolling hills of eastern Jefferson County, Kentucky. Founded in 
            1962 as a new single-family development in the suburban Louisville area it provides a beautiful

            the 7-acre Hardy Brinly Park which provides ample green space for all sorts of outdoor

What is Home Rule?

Section 156b of the Kentucky Constitution authorizes the General Assembly to grant broad home rule powers to cities, but does not require it. Fortunately, in 1980 the General Assembly did decide to grant broad home rule authority to all classes of cities through the adoption of KRS 82.082.  Prior to the enactment of the home rule statute, cities had no inherent right of self-government and depended almost exclusively upon specific acts of the General Assembly to authorize various functions.

Now, under KRS 82.082, a city may exercise any power or perform any function that is:

1) Within the boundaries of the city;

2) In furtherance of a public purpose of the city; and

3) Not in conflict with a constitutional provision or statute.

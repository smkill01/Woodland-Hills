  <button class="accordion">Mayor David Tilford</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Mayor Tilford has been serving in the Woodland Hills Government for over 15 years, beginning as a 
    commissioner. Under his leadership, we have experienced improvements in responsiveness to residents and
    their concerns, as well as several major projects in Hardy Brinly Memorial Park. He serves with his wife
    of over 40 years, Sally Tilford, and plans to continue to serve in some capacity for the forseeable future.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Michael Ochs</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Mike serves as a commissioner for the City of Woodland Hills, and is currently in his fourth term. Mr. 
    Ochs is  still active as a Seargent Major in the United States Army, and brings a unique level of 
    leadership to the Board of Commissioners.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Sally Tilford</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Sally Tilford serves as a commisioner for the City of Woodland Hills. She has served with her husband,
    David Tilford for over a decade, and her enthusiasm is never more evident than it is during the 
    Woodland Hills Summerfest, where she cooks for hundreds in the heat every year.
  </p>

  <button class="accordion">Brad Ricca</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Brad Ricca currently serves as a commisioner for the City of Woodland Hills. His spirit for service 
    is easy to see, especially in volunteering around the neighborhood during pickup events, along with 
    his wife and children.
